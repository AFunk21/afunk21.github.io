        <h2>Historic Dowtown Grapevine</h2>
        <section class="about-city">
            <p>Founded in 1844, Grapevine is the oldest community in Tarrant County. In 1888, when the Cotton Belt Railroad came to Grapevine, businesses flourished and the wooden buildings on Main Street were replaced with new structures constructed of locally-made brick. At least 80 percent of the commercial buildings you see are from that time. In 1907, Grapevine was incorporated as a city and many important services were initiated for the community of 500 people. Today, Grapevine is an amazing city of nearly 50,000 people. The city is located between Dallas and Fortworth, also known as part of the "Mid-Cities". Grapevine is known for its superb quality of life and for the many festivals and events held here throughout the year. In 2012, the International Festivals & Events Association named Grapevine as a "World Festival & Event City." Grapvine is known as the Chrismas capital of Texas. All of the local shops participate in the festivities and decorations to provide a wonderful Holiday atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Engine 2248 was originally purchased by the Southern Pacific Railroad and used in California for passenger and freight service. The train goes by the name of Puffy. The train has been converted into a fire train and then used as a ceremonial engine before ending up in a private collection where Walt Disney was eyeing her for a railroad project that never came to be. Helping Puffy shoulder the Grapevine Vintage Railroad's passenger load is Diesel 2199, a GP-7 (meaning general purpose) built in 1953 and originally operated by the Santa Fe Railroad and now referred to as Vinny. You can purchas your <a href="https://www.grapevinetexasusa.com/grapevine-vintage-railroad/purchase-tickets/">tickets</a>to ride on the train and see the town. There are three different types of train excursions: Tahwahkarrow Creek, Cotton Belt Route, and Trinity River.</p>
